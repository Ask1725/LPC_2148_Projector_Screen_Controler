# LPC2148 Projector Control
This project demonstrates the up/down motion control of a projector screen using the LPC2148 microcontroller and DC motors.

## Components
- LPC2148 MCU Board
- L293D Motor Driver IC
- DC Motors
- Projector

## How it Works
Upon powering the projector, the LPC2148 controls the motor direction (clockwise/anticlockwise) to move the screen. The motion is programmed using embedded C.

## Code
The embedded C code can be found in the `code/` directory.

## Documentation
Detailed project report and diagrams are available in the `docs/` folder.
